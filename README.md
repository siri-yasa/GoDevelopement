errorhandling in Go:
"errors" is a type to represent any issue in the execution of a function.
i.e invalid input or prob connecting to external service.....
error type is an interface type that have one function.
type error interface {
    error() string
}
The most commonly-used error implementation is the errors packageâ€™s unexported errorString type.
type errorString struct {
    s string
}
func (e *errorString) Error() string {
    return e.s
}
 New returns an error that formats as the given text.
func New(text string) error {
    return &errorString{text}
}
Handle the errors:
errors.Is is better than ==
== is relatively error-prone and can only compare the current error type but can not unwrap. Therefore, errors.Is or errors.As are better choices.

Type Assertion:
Type Assertion provide access to the exact type of a variable of an interface.
If already the data type is present in the interface, then it will retrieve the acutal datatype value held by the interface.
A type assertion takes an interface value and extracts from it a value of the specified explicit type. Basically, it is used to remove the ambiguity from the interface variables.
